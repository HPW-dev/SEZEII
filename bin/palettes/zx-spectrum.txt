;Palette Name: ZX Spectrum
;Description: A true-to-hardware palette. Please note that the luminesence of the ZX Spectrum is dictated by the voltage output of the hardware (85% voltage for non-bright, 100% for bright) - so instead of using E/F values as dictated in the wikipedia article in the hex for non-bright/bright, the colours are instead D8/FF (D8 being 85% of FF). For example, non-bright red is given as EE0000 in the article - instead it has been portrayed here as D80000 to give as close to hardware output as possible on modern screens.
